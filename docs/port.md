A port within a [Bridge](bridge.html).

Most commonly, a port has exactly one ``interface,'' pointed to by its
[interfaces](port.html#interfaces-column) column.  Such a port logically corresponds to a
port on a physical Ethernet switch.  A port with more than one interface is a
''bonded port'' (see [Bonding Configuration] (Bonding Configuration)).

Some properties that one might think as belonging to a port are actually part of
the port's [Interface](interface.html) members.

If port has an IP address, then it becomes L3 and might participate in VRFs.
Unless referenced interface has an "internal" type, L3 port can not participate
in the bridge. "internal" ports that basically represent VLAN interfaces may be
referenced by both Bridge and VRF.

## 1. Other Features group

### 1.1 egress_redirect_to_port column

When set, egress traffic of this port will be redirected to the referenced port.

### 1.2 flood_block column

When set to &#8216;true&#8217;, all flood traffic received from and forwarded to
this port will be dropped. The default value is `false`.

### 1.3 egress_blocked_to_ports column

When set, all traffic which ingresses this port will be blocked from being
forwarded out of the specified ports.

### 1.4 mac_learn_disable column

When set to 'true', mac learning will be disabled on the port. The default value
is `false`.

### 1.5 other_config : proxy_arp_enabled key

Enables proxy ARP feature on the port. Default is false. Port should be part of
VRF in order for the feature to be active.

### 1.6 other_config : local_proxy_arp_enabled key

Enables local proxy ARP feature on the port. Default is false. Port should be
part of VRF in order for the feature to be active.

### 1.7 other_config : sflow-enabled key

Determines whether sflow sampling is enabled on this port. Default is true.

### 1.8 mac column

The MAC address to use for this port for the purpose of choosing the bridge's
MAC address.  This column does not necessarily reflect the port's actual MAC
address, nor will setting it change the port's actual MAC address.

### 1.9 mclag_remote_interfaces column

List of interfaces on the MCLAG peer device which are part of same LAG.
[MCLAG_Remote_Interface](mclag_remote_interface.html)

## 2. VLAN Configuration group

Bridge ports support the following types of VLAN configuration:

+ __trunk__:    A trunk port carries packets on one or more VLANs specified in
the [trunks](port.html#trunks-column) column (or all VLANs defined in [VLAN](vlan.html) table if
trunks is empty or not specified). A packet that ingresses on a trunk port is in
the VLAN specified in its 802.1Q header, or VLAN 1 if the packet has no 802.1Q
header.  A packet that egresses through a trunk port will have an 802.1Q header
if it has a nonzero VLAN ID.    Any packet that ingresses on a trunk port tagged
with a VLAN that the port does not trunk is dropped.
+ __access__:    An access port carries packets on exactly one VLAN specified in
the [tag](port.html#tag-column) column.  Packets egressing on an access port have no 802.1Q
header.    Any packet with an 802.1Q header with a nonzero VLAN ID that
ingresses on an access port is dropped, regardless of whether the VLAN ID in the
header is the access port's VLAN ID.
+ __native-tagged__:   A native-tagged port resembles a trunk port, with the
exception that a packet without an 802.1Q header that ingresses on a native-
tagged port is in the ``native VLAN'' (specified in the [tag](port.html#tag-column) column).
+ __native-untagged__:   A native-untagged port resembles a native-tagged port,
with the exception that a packet that egresses on a native-untagged port in the
native VLAN will not have an 802.1Q header.

A packet will only egress through bridge ports that carry the VLAN of the
packet, as described by the rules above.

### 2.1 trunks column

For a trunk, native-tagged, or native-untagged port, the 802.1Q VLAN or VLANs
that this port trunks; if it is empty, then the port trunks all VLANs defined in
the [VLAN](vlan.html) table.  Must be empty if this is an access port.

A native-tagged or native-untagged port always trunks its native VLAN,
regardless of whether [trunks](port.html#trunks-column) includes that VLAN.

### 2.2 tag column

For an access port, the port's implicitly tagged VLAN.  For a native-tagged or
native-untagged port, the port's native VLAN.  Must be empty if this is a trunk
port.

### 2.3 vlan_mode column

The VLAN mode of the port, as described above.  When this column is empty, a
default mode is selected as follows:

+ If [tag](port.html#tag-column) contains a value, the port is an access port.  The
[trunks](port.html#trunks-column) column should be empty.
+ Otherwise, the port is a trunk port.  The [trunks](port.html#trunks-column) column value
is honored if it is present.

### 2.4 vlan_tunnel_keys column

Specifies translation from a vlan to the [Logical_Switch](logical_switch.html). If
this is an access port, only one key needs to be specified. VLAN 0 means that
untagged traffic on the port is mapped to the specified logical switch.

## 3. QoS configuration group

Specifies QoS (Quality of Service) port configuration options.

### 3.1 qos column

References schedule profile for this port. If this is unspecified, then the
schedule profile referenced in [System](system.html)) table qos will be used.

Specifies the port COS override to use. If the key is not specified, then no
override will be enabled.

### 3.3 qos_config : dscp_override key

Specifies the port DSCP override to use. If the key is not specified, then no
override will be enabled.

### 3.4 qos_config : qos_trust key

Specifies the individual port QoS Trust Mode.

`none` - no fields are inspected on arriving packets.  The initial local-
priority and color meta-data values are taken from PCP 0 entry of the COS Map
table (see [QoS_COS_Map_Entry](qos_cos_map_entry.html)).

`cos` - will use the PCP of the outermost 802.1 VLAN tag to index the COS Map
entry to initialize the local-priority and color meta-data values of the packet.
For untagged packets, the initial local-priority and color meta-data values are
taken from code_point 0 entry of the COS Map table (see
[QoS_COS_Map_Entry](qos_cos_map_entry.html)).

`dscp` - will use the DSCP value of IP packets to index the DSCP Map entry to
initialize the local-priority and color meta-data values of the packet.  For
non-IP packets, what meta-data values are assigned is hardware dependent.

If the key is not specified, then the qos_trust value in the [System](system.html)
table will be used.

### 3.5 q_profile column

This column complements the [lacp_status](port.html#lacp-status-column) column.

### 9.10 bond_status : state key

Enumeration summarizing the fowarding state of the bond.  It is based on the
aggregate state of the individual member interfaces. * Up: At least one member
interface is eligible and should be fowarding traffic according to LACP *
Blocked:  All member interfaces are either not eligible or should be blocked
according to LACP. If LACP-fallback-ab is enabled, and the
[lacp_status](port.html#lacp-status-column) is defaulted, then the bond state is forwarding.
If the LACP-fallback-ab is disable, then the state is blocked. * Down:  All
member interfaces configured to be a member of a LAG are either administratively
or operatively down

### 9.11 forwarding_state column

The Port's forwarding state is determined by the state of the interface or
interfaces in case of LAG and by the information provided by protocols working
at the logical port level, MSTP for example.

The value is set after all possible conditions have been taken into account.
The conditions are evaluated by an arbiter that takes the decision of which
value to set on the forwarding state based on protocol state.

### 9.12 forwarding_state : port_aggregation_blocked_reason key

port_loop_protection_blocked_reason key. Default value is `false`.

### 9.16 forwarding_state : port_aggregation_forwarding key

Port aggregation is set based on the information provided by protocols related
to link aggregation. The asserting protocol setting the value of this key is
defined in the port_aggregation_blocked_reason key. Additionally, this key is
used to aggregate the state of the links members of the LAG.  For example, it is
possible that all links on a LAG are blocked by a security protocol.  This is
reflected in this key. Default value is `false`.

## 10. Loop-protect Statistics group

### 10.1 loop_protect_statistics : loop_count key

Number of times a loop has been detected on this port.

## 11. Hardware Port Configuration group

`false`.

### 11.4 hw_config : internal-vlan key

The VLAN associated with l3 interfaces.

## 12. MACs Validity group

### 12.1 macs_invalid column

If `true`, indicates that MACs on this port are invalid. This might be set by
any agent of the system that decides that MACs are indeed invalid. Eventually
those MACs will be cleared from the system and macs_invalid will revert to
`false`.

### 12.2 macs_invalid_on_vlans column

If a set of VLANs is specified, it indicates that MACs on this port and that set
of VLANs are invalid. This might be set by any agent of the system that decides
that MACs are indeed invalid. Eventually those MACs will be cleared from the
system and macs_invalid_on_vlans will revert to an empty set.

## 13. Bonding Configuration group

A port that has more than one interface is a ``bonded port.'' Bonding allows for
load balancing and fail-over.

The following modes (bond_mode) require the upstream switch to support 802.3ad
with successful LACP negotiation.

These columns apply only to bonded ports.  Their values are otherwise ignored.

### 13.1 bond_mode column

The type of bonding used for a bonded port. Bond mode controls the selection of
a interface from a group of aggregate interfaces with which to transmit a frame.
This selection is performed with a hash function using either source and
destination mac addresses (l2), ip addresses (l3) or tcp/udp ports (l4) as
parameters. Defaults to `l3-src-dst-hash` if not assigned.

### 13.2 LACP Configuration group

LACP, the Link Aggregation Control Protocol, is an IEEE standard that allows
switches to automatically detect that they are connected by multiple links and
aggregate across those links.  These settings control LACP behavior.

#### 13.2.1 lacp column

Configures LACP on this port.  LACP allows directly connected switches to
negotiate which links may be bonded.  LACP may be enabled on non-bonded ports
for the benefit of any switches they may be connected to.  `active` ports are
allowed to initiate LACP negotiations.  `passive` ports are allowed to
participate in LACP negotiations initiated by a remote switch, but not allowed
to initiate such negotiations themselves.  If LACP is enabled on a port whose
partner switch does not support LACP, the bond will be disabled. Defaults to
`off` if unset.

#### 13.2.2 other_config : lacp-time key

The LACP timing which should be used on this [Port](port.html). By default `slow` is
used.  When configured to be `fast` LACP heartbeats are requested at a rate of
once per second causing connectivity problems to be detected more quickly.  In
`slow` mode, heartbeats are requested at a rate of once every 30 seconds.

#### 13.2.3 other_config : lacp_fallback_mode key

Specifies the mode used when fallback is enabled.  Priority mode uses the LACP
interface priority to decide which port remains forwarding when no partner is
detected.  The all_active mode keeps all interfaces forwarding when no partner
is detected. The default value is `priority`.

#### 13.2.4 other_config : lacp_fallback_timeout key

Defines the time period during which fallback remains active.  The timer starts
at the point when the interface state machine expires and configures the default
partner.  The unit is seconds. A value of 0 means that the timer doesn't run and
fallback is active until it is disabled by the user or a partner is detected.
The default value is `0`.

#### 13.2.5 other_config : lacp-system-id key

The LACP system ID of this [Port](port.html).  The system ID of a LACP bond is used
to identify itself to its partners.  Must be a nonzero MAC address. Defaults to
the bridge Ethernet address if unset.

#### 13.2.6 other_config : lacp-system-priority key

The LACP system priority of this [Port](port.html).  In LACP negotiations, link
status decisions are made by the system with the numerically lower priority.

#### 13.2.7 other_config : mclag_enabled key

Determines whether this port is an MCLAG. Default is false.

#### 13.2.8 other_config : lacp-fallback key

Specifies if fallback should be used on this [Port](port.html). Set this value to
`true` to enable the member interfaces based on the fallback mode and set to
`false` to block all interfaces when LACP = off. If not specified, lacp-fallback
is assumed to be false.

## 14. Loop-protect per port Configuration group

### 14.1 loop_protect_action column

This determines action for the Loop-protect feature.The value is set to "tx-
port-disable" for disabling the sending port on detecting a loop, "tx-rx-
disable" disables both sending and receiving ports when loop is detected and
"do-not-disable" will not disable any port. Default value is `tx-port-disable`.

### 14.2 loop_protect_enable column

When set to `true`, Loop-protect is enabled on this port. Default value is
`false`.

## 15. QoS Status group

### 15.1 qos_status : schedule_profile key

Contains the name of the schedule profile that is operating in hardware. This
may different than the name in [qos](port.html#qos-column) when that profile cannot be
supported in hardware.
